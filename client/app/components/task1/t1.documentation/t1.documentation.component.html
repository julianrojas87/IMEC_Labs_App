            The approach I decided to take to provide a solution for this assigment 
            was to build a MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) Web application which 
        </span>
        <span>
            integrates every solution for each task while giving a nice UI. This also was 
            made aiming to present evidence of my software developemt skills on the NodeJS environment.

            Specifically for Task 1, my approach consisted on parsing the RDF-Turtle data set 
            into a data model stored on a Mongo DB that allowed me to query it an extract the information I needed.
            The steps I took to achive this are described next: 
        </span>
    </p>
    <ol start="1">
        <li>
            <span>The first step was to find a RDF-Turtle parser and after looking over the Web I found the </span>
            <span><a href="https://github.com/RubenVerborgh/N3.js" target="_blank">Ruben Verborgh N3 parser.</a></span>
            <span>
                This parser provides a easy to use tool for reading turtle files. It starts identifying all the 
                <mark>@prefix </mark>elements defined and then 
            </span>
            <span>works in a loop giving on each iteration a JS object like this: <mark>&#123;subject: '', predicate: '', object: ''&#125;</mark>.</span>
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <span>Next it was necessary to know which were the different entities that the turtle data set was describing. </span>
            <span>
                For this I used the parser to go over the data set and discover every different type of entity and its properties. 
                Knowing that every time the predicate <mark>http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type</mark>, also put as a simple <mark>'a'</mark>  
                was present it was declaring a new entity, allowed me to identify 6 different entities and their relations as shown next:
            </span>
            <img style="width: 800; position: relative; top: 20; left: 150; margin-bottom: 25;" src="resources/img/erd.png">
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <p>
                <span>Once I had the model, the next step was to build the algorithm that will map every entity and its properties into a MongoDB collection. </span>
                <span>Since on every iteration the parser returns an object, I could take the subject parameter to identify to which entity does a property belongs. </span>
                <span>
                    I noticed that through out the data set almost every entity was grouped with its properties, which made it easy to parse it. 
                    But there were some properties that were present outside its entity group and for them I had to identify to which type of entity it belonged 
                    and then assing it to the corresponding entity.
                </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>
                    This algorithm will build every entity and store it in an array, having a different array for every type of entity. This process will continue
                    until the whole data set has been parsed and then it will proceed to store every array in a MongoDB collection. Before it starts the parsing 
                    process, the algorithm will check the MongoDB and if it does not find any data in it, will proceed to parse the data-set. Such verification
                    will be done every time the node application is started. The algorithm is implemented on the <mark>parser/turtle-parser.js</mark> file.
                </span>
            </p>
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <p>
                <span>
                    Having a MongoDB collection for every entity makes much easier to obtain a complete list of Stations and Stops through a 
                    Mongo parser such as mongoose. Therefore, I built a REST api, using express, that allowed me to query the DB and obtain the data.
                </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>
                    Finally for presenting the data I created a UI using Angular2 and Bootstrap where I consume the REST api and display the lists of 
                    Stations and Stops.
