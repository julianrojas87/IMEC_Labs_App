            As mentioned in the documentation of Task 1, having the information of the data set available as a data model
            in a Mongo DB makes it very easy to access it. For this task we have an input parameter: <mark>Station.label</mark>,
            which will be used to identify the Stop associated to that Station.   
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            As determined in the Task 1 the relation between Stops an Stations is given by the <mark>Stop.parentStation</mark> parameter
            which points to a Station ID &#40;<mark>Station.id</mark>&#41;. Therefore, having the name of a Station allows to find the Station ID and then
            use that parameter to find the Stop with the same Parent Station.

            For this, I exposed a function in the Express REST api that has the following URL: <mark>/api/stop/:name</mark>. Where ':name' is the 
            name of the Station. The function returns a JSON object containing all the information of the related Stop. Such function can be found on 
            the <mark>/routes/tasks.js</mark> script.    
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            On the Front-End side I decided to implement a general UI that allow to retrieve the Stop information not only for the requested Stations
            in the task but for all the Stations present in the data-set. For this, a bootstrap-select is used containing all the Stations names. When
            a Station name is selected the described REST api method is invoked and a table like structure is filled with the retrieved Stop data. Next
            are some screen captures for the requested Stations on this task (Hamler and Trumann-Rohrersville):
