            To answer this task's question: Yes I was able to find a result. Follwing is the description of the steps I took to get it:   
        </span>
    </p>
    <ol start="1">
        <li>
            <span>The first thing I did was to examine the response of the given example 
                <a target="_blank" href="http://server02.openknowledge.be:8082/connections/?departureTime=1970-01-01T12:00">URL</a>
            </span>
            <span> and realize it gives a set of Connections for a given Departure Time and those Connections were expressed using Hydra format.</span>
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <span>
                My next step was to analyze and test the 
                <a href="https://github.com/linkedconnections/client.js" target="_blank">Linked Connections Client</a>.
                After testing this client, I realized that it takes three parameters (departureStop, arrivalStop and departureTime) and queries the 
                data set looking for a connection. If it does not find one it changes the Departure Time adding 10 minutes and queries again. The client
                continues this process until it finds a connection that has not to be necessarily a direct one, it can find a path from the origin 
                to the destination going through several stops. 
            </span>
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <span>
                Knowing this, I proceeded to integrate the client into this application and exposed a function that allows to use it, based on the 
                documentation example. The client is present in the <mark>linked_connections_client/lc_client.js</mark> file. 
            </span>
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <span>
                I noticed that the client will continue to search for a Connection indefinitely, therefore it was necessary to define a stop condition 
                in case no Connection was present in the data set for the givem parameters. The first thing I did was to manually determine what was the extent 
                of the data set, finding that the last Departure Date that returns Connections data was <mark>1970-JAN-31 00:40</mark>. Having this, I set the
                client search function to stop if that date was exceeded. 
            </span>
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <span>
                Another thing I noticed was that if there are no Connections for a given set of parameters, it will take a considerable amount of time 
                to query every 10 minutes through out the month specially if the initial Departure time was at the begining of the month. Considering this
                I decided to define another stop condition setting a 24 hours limit for the client to look for a Connection. Meaning that if the client does
                not find a Connection in the following 24 hours of the initial Dearture Time, it will stop looking.  
            </span>
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <span>
                Having integrated the client into the application and exposed it through my REST api, I proceeded to build the UI. The requirement for this task
                asks to look for connections from <mark>Hamler platform 0</mark> to <mark>Trumann-Rohrersville platform 0</mark>, but I decided to implement a
                more generic function that allowed to look for Connections between any of the Stations defined by the data set. Also my UI allows to specify
                the Departure Time by selecting the date and time (restricted to January 1970 only).  
            </span>
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <span>
                Once the UI was implemented I focused on presenting the information returned by the client. When the client finds a path between two stations
                it returns an array of Connection objects with a set of parameters. Among those parameters are the departure and arrival stops, but only their
                IDs, and presenting that data directly does not transmit much information to the user. Knowing that a Stop has a Parent Station, I decided to take
                the stop IDs returned by the client for each Connection and retrieve the related Station from my Mongo DB to present a more clear information
                regarding the Path found.  
            </span>
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <span>
                Finally, here I present a screenshot of the result obtained for a query using the stations requested by this task and a Departure Time of 
                <mark>1970-JAN-01 09:00</mark>.  
            </span>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p style="margin-top: 50; margin-bottom: 70">
        <span>
            <h4>Hamler -> Trumann-Rohrersville (1970-JAN-01 09:00)</h4>

        <span style="font-weight: bold">**Note: </span>
        <span>
            After making several tests with the client with different parameters I noticed that in some cases the client froze and never returned.
            Unfortunately I was not able to determine what was causing the freezing or to implement a exception handler for this scenario.
